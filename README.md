## Description

Music Analytica serves as a tool that retrieves a Spotify userâ€™s music listening history and encapsulates a suite of functionality for representing various recommendations, insights, and manipulation of the Spotify user experience based on that data. It combines specific user data, Spotify Artists information, and recommendation models to manipulate user's playlists, listening queues, and present useful findings of their listening history. Music Analytica makes use of the expansive, robust Spotify API and is programmed entirely in Python. 

## Artist Recommendations

This is an example of the Artist Recommendation feature for Music Analytica. Using the Spotify API, a list is generated of 5 artists that are recommended to the user given their music listening habits.
